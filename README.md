## Laboratory Activity 1

### 1. Password and Box Control
This code is a input-type form in HTML. It is used to maintain data confidentiality by creating password field with any safe ways to maintain privacy, be it in asterisks or in dot form. This code also enable users to input their credentials and have the option to reset or clear all.

### 2. Check Boxes
This code shows an interactive form that determines which pets they have at home by using checkboxes while allowing multiple selection. It is also promotes user-friendliness in the UI. Moreover, the use of the tags and attributes are well-implemented which enables an organized code and UI.


### 3. Option Buttons
The form used radio buttons to have users to only pick one option out of many. All attribute was named same with each other to ensure one option will be chosen by the users. Clear all is also an option which is implemented through reset button.

### 4. Text Area controls
This code also uses form and textarea elements. The code includes default texts, but it can always be change to user input by adding placeholder attribute (could be anything) which disappears when the user starts writing. This one also includes reset button for users. Also, use of unnecessary legends such as the code above "A Simple Interview" are discouraged to maintain visual organization of the code. Instead, the inner legend found in the code could be changed to h2.

### 5.  OPTGROUP tag
The code depicts a correct structure following the HTML5 standards. It also shows a dropdown list where the users can choose from the list of provinces in the Philippines. Reset button is also present for easier cancellation of selection. Additionaly, if this section is created alone,  a submit button or confirmation would also be helpful with the output of the code to enable users to send their selection.

### 6. FIELDSET and LEGEND tags | READONLY attribute | DISABLED attribute
The code is correct overall, but if it is to be created alone, a submit button would add more an important aspect on the expected output. Also, adding of placeholders that disappears when the user starts typing, would be also good for visuals.

### 7. Submit Query and Reset Buttons
The HTML code creates a clear and user-friendly credit card application form, collecting essential details like name, sex, and annual salary. It effectively uses fieldset, legend, and accessible labels, ensuring a structured and interactive user experience.
