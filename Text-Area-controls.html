<!--This code also uses form and textarea elements. The code includes default texts, but it can always be change to user input by
adding placeholder attribute (could be anything) like this: 
<textarea id="About_Me" name="About_Me" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="Write about yourself here..."></textarea><br><br> 
which disappears when the user starts writing. This one also includes reset button for users. Also, use of unnecessary legends
such as the code above "A Simple Interview" are discouraged to maintain visual organization of the code. 
Instead, the inner legend found in the code could be changed to <h2></h2>. -->
